_From `team/<name>.md`; each person writes only their own file._

**Aleks** — Duels I done (30/34 deals, 13.93 duel points). **Duels II ≈ 20:33** (PLAN #18). **Duelist LIVE on 42f4522 (+ --days-read auto) since 19:26:18** (Duels II days + rounds rollback + Duel Lab + per-duel accepts + no claims, Opus medium + Sonnet low). The Duel Lab picks are in that code (69ef465): **no restart needed** (Lucas 17:3x). Until the **19:30 code freeze**: offline red-team sims only (no server, no team key, no 2nd process; a change goes in only with the suite green AND a clear sim gain). **20:25** check one live process, no errors; on screen **20:33** until wave 1 ends. First wave: no step > 18% of the gap outside the last 3 ticks, day reading ≠ CAN'T READ, `review` pred = points, share per deal vs 0.58.
  - Sat 19:26 · duelist restarted on Lucas's merged `--days-read` switch (42f4522, PLAN #24; HEAD f53e0b9) with `--days-read auto` (= the old reading), same flags; full suite 440 pass, no live duels, one process · log `logs/duelist/supervise-20261003-1926.log` · at the first days duel (≈ 20:33): console day line vs `days_meaning`; reversed → restart with `--days-read flip`, unclear → `unsure`
  - Sat 18:18 · **duelist red team done, offline** → `docs/duelist-redteam.md` (code: branch `redteam-sim`, `redteam/`; never touched the game or the team key, no 2nd process; ≈ $10–11 API) · **no code change tonight**: 9 rule tweaks over 2,940 simulated days duels vs Duels I's bot types × 7 day behaviours, none clearly better (best +1.7%: no late switch); real models land where the stand-in does (0.347 vs 0.352, 28 paired duels); 19 bait/injection texts ×2 changed no move (0 accepts, 0 fallbacks) · **the risk is our day reading**: read right 0.47 points/duel, direction unknown 0.23, unreadable 0.15, **backwards −0.18 with 30% negative deals** → at 20:33 check the first duel's day line against `days_meaning` by eye · Sunday: Opus medium goes over the 10 s budget in ~5% of decisions (p90 9.5 s at 6 at once); Opus low max 8.0 s at about the same quality (0.386 vs 0.424, 5 better / 6 worse of 20), Sonnet medium closes fewer (0.273) → Opus low + failover budget ≈ tick − 8 s · next: 20:25 one-process check, on screen 20:33
  - Sat 17:32 · duelist red-team plan (offline only, < $20 API) + free probes · (1) `guards.claims` lets through statements about our limit ('the most I can pay', 'my floor/maximum/ceiling', 'bottom line'), third parties ('elsewhere', 'my boss'), 'mint' and number words ('Fifty'). Posture ('final') is not flaggable (GAME.md), none of our 352 Duels I texts used these phrases, and whether the judge counts them is unknown → bait test with real models before any change · (2) Sunday: at 15 s ticks the decide timeout is 10 s (tick − 5) but Failover gives the primary 20 s, so the backup model never runs; Duels I decisions took p50 6.0 s / p95 8.1 s on Opus low, and tonight's Opus medium strategist took 6.4-10.9 s alone in the smoke → expect many code fallbacks · (3) the cost meter (`engine/claude.py`) doesn't count cache tokens, so logged spend is low · next: arena in a worktree (fake server, Duels I bot types × day behaviours), on my go

**Dani** — Desk, still open: Q6 (do duel threads count in the 6 open conversations? Duels II runs 6 at once ≈ 18:29), venue bond cooldown length, Q7 judging, Q4 ladder "price range" (do above-list deals count?), Q3 cap flat 50 or 5×book. Answered: stale `day_closes fri` did nothing (Lucas 10:50); Round 3 + CHA re-anchored to Sun ≈ 09:29 (server, log 11:44). Room: RET holders/collectors in log 11:44; steer other teams' trades to our v10 (0% fee: one trade there took us #4 → #2 at 10:45); no sell pitches (no line in `intel/opportunities.md` is live; top 4 at tick 424: t14, t13, t18, t12, and it moves every few minutes, so check the live board). Pitch draft with Lucas during Duels I (11:59-~13:34). Dashboard on my laptop (http://127.0.0.1:8765, read-only; Duel monitor tab at `#duelmon` for Duels I/II/III) rewrites `intel/teams.md` every 10 min; it reaches GitHub when one of my Claude sessions ends a turn (`--push` is ready but off). Judges' showcase: http://127.0.0.1:8765/show (texts in `judges/show.json`).
  - Sat 18:20 · **dashboard: new "Team trades" tab** (http://127.0.0.1:8765/#trades): every settled team-to-team trade in the feed we hold (El Rastro + every team venue), newest first, with venue, seller → buyer (with ranks), cards (swaps both ways), price, fee, × book, buyer collects / seller dumps, **est. value created** (book × (buyer's − seller's set multiplier), ours exact, others from `intel/multipliers.json` [L]), top-4 and ours flags; filters day/venue/team/set/kind, only our venue, hide top 4; tables by venue and by team · no extra game request · first read (tick 965): 147 team trades recorded, **102 today, 2,121 P**, 66 on El Rastro (65 %), 10 swaps; team venues: v02 11, v07 10, v21 5, the rest ≤ 3; our v10 only 2 trades all day (ticks 311, 398: est. +10 / −10) · **git:** the 16:00 showcase session had left `/show` code uncommitted, so the hook pushed nothing of mine since 16:00; committed it (fd269ad), the pull conflicted on `intel/teams.md` only (Aleks's machine also commits it: 18:08), resolved with the newest copy (my dashboard's 18:11) with Dani's OK · next: who writes `intel/teams.md` (one machine only?), desk Q6/Q7
  - Sat 16:00 · judges: **showcase designed in Figma and built as `/show`** (brief `judges/dashboard-brief.md`) · Figma "Team 5 · Judges showcase" (https://www.figma.com/design/picVx0KcLHR9uY0ctMuVTu, my drafts): tokens as two collections, Dark and Light (the Starter plan allows one mode per collection), 13 text styles (Inter stands in for the dashboard's system-ui), 9 components (evidence chip [V]/[L]/[?], stat tile, fact card, section header, live indicator, waterfall bar, chat bubble us/rival, architecture node code/agent/human, learning-loop card) and the 1440 desktop frame (dark) with the real race (18 teams, ticks 90-630) and the Duels I waterfall; **the phone and light frames were not drawn in Figma: the Starter plan's MCP call limit ran out** (the build covers both) · **build:** `dashboard/show.html` + `/show` and `/api/show` in `dashboard/server.py`; story texts in `judges/show.json` (re-read every minute, no restart; `{deal_pct}`-style live values in headlines); no external files (works offline), light/dark (button or `?theme=`), phone layout checked at 390 px; **no extra game request** ("last seen" = last commit on origin/main; our `/api/me` rows at the story's ticks come from the collector's full history) · live now: #5, 28.34; Duels I 30/34 (88 %) vs the field 74 % (227/304, live; the brief's 76 % was 226/299) · dashboard restarted 15:58 on this code (key, hub on, 0 errors) · next: Dani reviews the page; fill the analysts' cost (TBD) in `show.json`; on Sunday add a day mark in `race.days` and point the waterfall at Duels II/III
  - Sat 13:28 · judges: **showcase dashboard brief** `judges/dashboard-brief.md` (for the Figma design + build): one page, 8 sections (hero, race, why we moved, Duels I, architecture, learning loop, what we measured, cost), components, rules (sources and [V]/[L] on every number, no room prices), build as `/show` on the dashboard, read-only, no extra game requests · now #5 (28.15); Duels I done for us: 30/34 deals, 478.9 of 591 P, 112 P lost to rounds; field 226/299 · Figma isn't connected in my Claude Code yet → next: connect Figma in claude.ai, new session designs from the brief

**Lucas** — Saturday: follow `intel/saturday-plan.md` (verified Fri night by 10 analyses, 4 verifiers, a pre-mortem and a fact-check). Four sessions on Lucas's machine (`intel/saturday-sessions.md`): **Chief of staff** (the only one Lucas talks to), **Operator** (the only game writer for trades and dealers), **Builder** (tools), **Market** (recorder, broker, venue). Morning steps: `intel/morning-start.md`. Trader and analysts are stopped until the operator's 09:00 checks.
  - Sat 21:17 · operator · **Duels II started 21:17** (6 live) · tiered rebate (Lucas OK: 5 P common, 10 P unc/rare, max 2 per team, cap 80) → ad posted 21:17:37 · pair-ad job: the first ad (≈ 21:24) is the matchmaker's #1, 'Team 8 has the RET-09 that Team 9 is missing… ~100 P', then every 12 min from intel/matches.md (table parser added; non-rival rows only, seller holds 2+ or dumps the set) · queue: t04 MAL-08 → t12, t08 MAL-03 → t12, t07 MAL-02 → t08
  - Sat 21:14 · operator · pair-ad filter patched (Chief: Team 15 has LAT, RET and LAV complete, lacks only MAL-09/10): t15 can be a buyer only of MAL-09/10 · dry run: only t02 SAL-03 → t08 qualifies
  - Sat 21:13 · operator · Pícaros egg (Chief, before Duels II; thread 1856, ticks 1230-1232, text only): 'Conozco el timo de la estampita, como Lazarillo y Rinconete. Sin trucos, ¿eh?' → 'sin trucos para ti... hoy' → **egg.found picaros t05 + badge 'Trickster tricked'** (badges: Sharp ear, Trickster tricked) · board tick 1230: **#2 31.93** (T10 34.6, T6 30.4)
