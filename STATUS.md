## Team: now and latest

_From `team/<name>.md`; each person writes only their own file._

**Aleks** — Standalone market negotiator ready in `agents/negotiator/`: Sonnet 5.5 medium strategist / low negotiator, our own reservation prices from holdings, set affinities, page needs and configurable goals (RET + CHA, completed pages protected), caller-supplied market snapshots, price only, configurable decay default 8%; full offline suite 537 pass. Unwired and dormant pending the market-open decision. Duels I + II done. **Duels II (22:38): 56 deals of 68, 1210.1 P** (Duels I: 30/34, 478.9 P). Duelist still running on f92fe34 (idle; next session Duels III Sun ≈ 11:29, 12 ticks, 10%). Sunday before 08:50 (PLAN #27): Opus effort LOW, fix failover timeout_s vs the 10 s budget, smoke 4 concurrent days duels p95 < 9 s; Duel Lab picks for Duels III (cap 0.18, MIN_STEP_P 5, LATE_SWITCH_LEFT 2) and branch `duelist-loop` are Aleks's 08:00 call.
  - Sun 09:46 · **duelist stopped on Aleks's machine** (supervisor + run, Aleks's call); lock free; monitor page (8766) left up · next: Duels III ≈ 11:00 runs only if someone starts it (one duelist per key)
  - Sun 07:10 · negotiator now calculates its own private limit through `for_trade`: collection marginal values, set affinity, duplicates and immediate page bonus; confirmed RET + CHA goals and completed-page protection; configurable wanted/neutral/unwanted/keep cards and profit margins; fees, cash reserve and committed bids/assets enforced in code, with fresh-state repricing and an explainable private breakdown · custom team-trade prompts retain 8% decay as internal urgency; 537 offline tests pass, including recorded catalog/team snapshots and fee-rounding boundaries · remains unwired; next: market-open decision and execution integration
  - Sun 06:46 · added standalone `agents/negotiator/` on the duelist core: Sonnet 5.5 medium strategy / low message writing, market book/bid/ask/trade snapshots with refresh support and private counterparty estimates, price-only inputs, `Params.decay` default 0.08 applied consistently to prompts and ledger · 513 offline tests pass; no live calls, runner, scheduler or game wiring · next: decide whether to connect it when markets open

**Dani** — Desk, still open: Q6 (do duel threads count in the 6 open conversations? Duels II runs 6 at once ≈ 18:29), venue bond cooldown length, Q7 judging, Q4 ladder "price range" (do above-list deals count?), Q3 cap flat 50 or 5×book. Answered: stale `day_closes fri` did nothing (Lucas 10:50); Round 3 + CHA re-anchored to Sun ≈ 09:29 (server, log 11:44). Room: RET holders/collectors in log 11:44; steer other teams' trades to our v10 (0% fee: one trade there took us #4 → #2 at 10:45); no sell pitches (no line in `intel/opportunities.md` is live; top 4 at tick 424: t14, t13, t18, t12, and it moves every few minutes, so check the live board). Pitch draft with Lucas during Duels I (11:59-~13:34). Dashboard on my laptop (http://127.0.0.1:8765, read-only; Duel monitor tab at `#duelmon` for Duels I/II/III) rewrites `intel/teams.md` every 10 min; it reaches GitHub when one of my Claude sessions ends a turn (`--push` is ready but off). Judges' showcase: http://127.0.0.1:8765/show (texts in `judges/show.json`).
  - Sat 18:20 · **dashboard: new "Team trades" tab** (http://127.0.0.1:8765/#trades): every settled team-to-team trade in the feed we hold (El Rastro + every team venue), newest first, with venue, seller → buyer (with ranks), cards (swaps both ways), price, fee, × book, buyer collects / seller dumps, **est. value created** (book × (buyer's − seller's set multiplier), ours exact, others from `intel/multipliers.json` [L]), top-4 and ours flags; filters day/venue/team/set/kind, only our venue, hide top 4; tables by venue and by team · no extra game request · first read (tick 965): 147 team trades recorded, **102 today, 2,121 P**, 66 on El Rastro (65 %), 10 swaps; team venues: v02 11, v07 10, v21 5, the rest ≤ 3; our v10 only 2 trades all day (ticks 311, 398: est. +10 / −10) · **git:** the 16:00 showcase session had left `/show` code uncommitted, so the hook pushed nothing of mine since 16:00; committed it (fd269ad), the pull conflicted on `intel/teams.md` only (Aleks's machine also commits it: 18:08), resolved with the newest copy (my dashboard's 18:11) with Dani's OK · next: who writes `intel/teams.md` (one machine only?), desk Q6/Q7
  - Sat 16:00 · judges: **showcase designed in Figma and built as `/show`** (brief `judges/dashboard-brief.md`) · Figma "Team 5 · Judges showcase" (https://www.figma.com/design/picVx0KcLHR9uY0ctMuVTu, my drafts): tokens as two collections, Dark and Light (the Starter plan allows one mode per collection), 13 text styles (Inter stands in for the dashboard's system-ui), 9 components (evidence chip [V]/[L]/[?], stat tile, fact card, section header, live indicator, waterfall bar, chat bubble us/rival, architecture node code/agent/human, learning-loop card) and the 1440 desktop frame (dark) with the real race (18 teams, ticks 90-630) and the Duels I waterfall; **the phone and light frames were not drawn in Figma: the Starter plan's MCP call limit ran out** (the build covers both) · **build:** `dashboard/show.html` + `/show` and `/api/show` in `dashboard/server.py`; story texts in `judges/show.json` (re-read every minute, no restart; `{deal_pct}`-style live values in headlines); no external files (works offline), light/dark (button or `?theme=`), phone layout checked at 390 px; **no extra game request** ("last seen" = last commit on origin/main; our `/api/me` rows at the story's ticks come from the collector's full history) · live now: #5, 28.34; Duels I 30/34 (88 %) vs the field 74 % (227/304, live; the brief's 76 % was 226/299) · dashboard restarted 15:58 on this code (key, hub on, 0 errors) · next: Dani reviews the page; fill the analysts' cost (TBD) in `show.json`; on Sunday add a day mark in `race.days` and point the waterfall at Duels II/III
  - Sat 13:28 · judges: **showcase dashboard brief** `judges/dashboard-brief.md` (for the Figma design + build): one page, 8 sections (hero, race, why we moved, Duels I, architecture, learning loop, what we measured, cost), components, rules (sources and [V]/[L] on every number, no room prices), build as `/show` on the dashboard, read-only, no extra game requests · now #5 (28.15); Duels I done for us: 30/34 deals, 478.9 of 591 P, 112 P lost to rounds; field 226/299 · Figma isn't connected in my Claude Code yet → next: connect Figma in claude.ai, new session designs from the brief

**Lucas** — Sun: CHA page COMPLETE (+50). RET-11 kept (t13 asks lapsed); MAL decision ≈ 12:00 (Chief); Duels III ≈ 11:00 (duelist stopped on Aleks's machine at 09:46: Chief alerted). (Sat history:) Saturday: follow `intel/saturday-plan.md` (verified Fri night by 10 analyses, 4 verifiers, a pre-mortem and a fact-check). Four sessions on Lucas's machine (`intel/saturday-sessions.md`): **Chief of staff** (the only one Lucas talks to), **Operator** (the only game writer for trades and dealers), **Builder** (tools), **Market** (recorder, broker, venue). Morning steps: `intel/morning-start.md`. Trader and analysts are stopped until the operator's 09:00 checks.
  - Sun 09:57 · operator · **RET-11 → t02 at 240** (offer 21583, El Rastro, addressed, exp tick 1653): t02 had bid 240 for it (addressed to t10); value 198 → +42 for us and denies t10 a +98 flip · Dani messages t02 · fallback 230 or a 0% member market (not v26/v10) on the Chief's word
  - Sun 09:55 · operator · floors 176/176 (until the MAL call ≈ 12:00) → trader restarted (cash-floor 176, HEAD 9bfae78), opps RET 176 · RET-11 held: look for a team buyer ≥ 220 (addressed, El Rastro; feed watcher for RET-11 bids); Pilar ≥ 198 only from 13:30 · the duelist now runs on THIS Mac (09:45, sha 29aa1be, C+; Chief's watchdog): never start another · the Grand Final ≈ 14:15 (dealers close), new dealer threads cut at 14:00
  - Sun 09:53 · operator · RET-11 → t13: 248 (20815) and the one re-post at 235 (21141) both expired unfilled → stopped (Chief told); RET-11 kept (reserved, 198); options: Pilar ≥ 198 or another buyer (Chief's call)

## Levels

- El Chato: None — Better packs and rare singles; he buys uncommon and rare cards. Open a thread with him (with: chato).
- Doña Pilar: None — A collector: she pays over book for the cards she loves and sells gold packs. Open a thread with her (with: pilar).
- Los Pícaros: None — Two brothers with bargains and bad faith: read every offer before you accept, and flag a trick (POST /api/flags).
- Don Ernesto: None — The vault: epic and legendary cards for whoever negotiates them, within hourly limits. Open a thread (with: banco).
- The Workshop: None — POST /api/taller {"assets": [a, b, c]}: three spare copies of one rarity (you keep at least one of each card) become one card of the next rarity. The pull is luck, shown and never scored.
- Radio Rastro: None — News on air: GET /api/news (newest first; also news.posted on the live stream). Three sources: the Boletín del Bazar (the Bazaar bulletin), Radio Rastro and El Tablón, the notice board. Some items are true and the market moves as they say; some are rumours that never happen; some are just Madrid. Nothing tells you which is which.
