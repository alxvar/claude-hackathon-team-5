**Aleks** — Duels I done (30/34 deals, 13.93 duel points). **Duels II ≈ 20:33** (PLAN #18). **Duelist LIVE on 4699673** (Duels II days + rounds rollback, Opus medium + Sonnet low). Duel Lab picks (PLAN #20) decided 16:24 and handed to my Builder: 18% step cap, days (no C/2 pre-pay, late switch at 4 left, middle-day opener → our corner), SILENT_KEEP 0.15; merge by 19:30. **Restart by ~20:15** after the full suite: `agents/duelist/supervise.sh --negotiator-model claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort medium --negotiator-effort low`. First wave: no step > 18% of the gap outside the last 3 ticks, day reading ≠ CAN'T READ, `review` pred = points, share per deal vs 0.58.
  - Sat 16:55 · **duel rival book** → `docs/duel-rivals.md` (68 records; consecutive duel ids = one rival team, verified: all 17 pairs same item, opposite roles) · **scripted vs LLM:** Duels I 16/17 scripted (fixed lines, formula prices: constant steps, midpoint, fixed repeat; 0 of 176 rival messages name our numbers), 1 silent (Team 11 [L]), **0 LLM**; Friday had 1 LLM team (121/122), which sent only its fallback line in Duels I (2318/2319) · clusters: followers (10/10 deals, 3.0 rounds), clock bots (7.6 rounds per deal), holders, accept-only, silent · replay 'stay silent vs clock bots': +32 P on 3 teams, −54 P on R15, −24 P overall → no blanket rule; a per-team fact by wording is possible (not built) · watch: days break un-updated bots (missing_days), wording may change, R3's LLM may return
  - Sat 16:30 · duelist restarted on the Duel Lab changes (69ef465, HEAD 46dfd5d), same flags (Opus medium + Sonnet low); full suite 417 pass, no live duels; reads Duels II (≈ 20:33) · log `logs/duelist/supervise-20261003-1630.log` · next: day reading at the first days duel
  - Sat 16:31 · Builder · **Duel Lab changes merged** (69ef465, Aleks's 16:24 picks, PLAN #20): (1) step cap `MAX_STEP_SHARE` 0.18: a mid-duel concession above 18% of the gap (in worth) is cut to it with code's text, rule `capped`, then the 3 P floor (under a ~17 P gap nothing goes out until the last 3 ticks); ledger + strategist name the largest step; (2) days hold = keep our day, no C/2 pre-pay; (3) late switch: once, from 4 ticks left (runner decides that tick), days apart and direction sure → their day at a worth-neutral price; (4) middle-day rival under linear weights → hold, answer with our end (no far-corner gift); (5) `SILENT_KEEP` 0.3 → 0.15 · full suite 417 pass (11 duelist tests fail on the old code) · smoke (real models, Opus medium + Sonnet low): price duel 70 → 65 (5 P, inside the 7 P cap, sent as drafted; strategist 5.9 s); days duel 70 day 4 → 64 day 10 + 'day 4 at 70' in words (middle day → our end, as the Lab asks; 7.3 s); neither drafted a step big enough to cut, so the cut and the switch were checked on the runner offline: `offer 126 P [capped] :: I can do 126 P.` and `offer 105 P day 0 [late switch] :: I can do 105 P, delivery on day 0.` · **not live: restart by ~20:15 (Aleks) with `agents/duelist/supervise.sh --negotiator-model claude-sonnet-5-5 --effort medium --negotiator-effort low`** · first-wave gates: no concession over 18% of the gap outside the last 3 ticks; day reading not CAN'T READ; `review` pred = points on days deals; our share per deal vs Duels I's ~0.58

**Dani** — Desk, still open: Q6 (do duel threads count in the 6 open conversations? Duels II runs 6 at once ≈ 18:29), venue bond cooldown length, Q7 judging, Q4 ladder "price range" (do above-list deals count?), Q3 cap flat 50 or 5×book. Answered: stale `day_closes fri` did nothing (Lucas 10:50); Round 3 + CHA re-anchored to Sun ≈ 09:29 (server, log 11:44). Room: RET holders/collectors in log 11:44; steer other teams' trades to our v10 (0% fee: one trade there took us #4 → #2 at 10:45); no sell pitches (no line in `intel/opportunities.md` is live; top 4 at tick 424: t14, t13, t18, t12, and it moves every few minutes, so check the live board). Pitch draft with Lucas during Duels I (11:59-~13:34). Dashboard on my laptop (http://127.0.0.1:8765, read-only; Duel monitor tab at `#duelmon` for Duels I/II/III) rewrites `intel/teams.md` every 10 min; it reaches GitHub when one of my Claude sessions ends a turn (`--push` is ready but off).
  - Sat 13:28 · judges: **showcase dashboard brief** `judges/dashboard-brief.md` (for the Figma design + build): one page, 8 sections (hero, race, why we moved, Duels I, architecture, learning loop, what we measured, cost), components, rules (sources and [V]/[L] on every number, no room prices), build as `/show` on the dashboard, read-only, no extra game requests · now #5 (28.15); Duels I done for us: 30/34 deals, 478.9 of 591 P, 112 P lost to rounds; field 226/299 · Figma isn't connected in my Claude Code yet → next: connect Figma in claude.ai, new session designs from the brief
  - Sat 12:57 · **why we reached #3** (our `/api/me` per tick + leaderboard snapshots 450 → 570 + `intel/score-model.md`) · 22.66 #10 → **29.57 #3** (+6.91, the biggest rise in the top 8: t14 +2.71, t18 +3.32, t12 +2.55, t10 +3.86, t17 +3.18, t13 −0.03) · market flat (7.5) and `neg_points` flat (35.2): **all of it is Negotiating, 15.16 → 22.07** · since Duels I scored, Saturday Negotiating = 0.6 × (team trades + ladder) + duel part (≤ 12 Saturday points) [V, score-model 1b]; 1 Saturday point = 0.667 board · approx. split [L, score-model rates]: **(1) duels ≈ +6 board**: `duel_points` 0 → 10-11; Aleks 12:52: 21 deals of 23 (91 %) vs the field 80 %; **(2) ladder ≈ +4 board**: 4 dealer sells at no `neg_points` cost, `ladder_points` 0.055 → 0.181: LAT-08 → Chato (tick 481), MAL-07, SAL-08, MAL-06 → Pilar (508, 522, 551; Pilar is level 3, higher levels weigh more); the 11:35 ladder program copied what Team 13 did (deals at list, then Pilar); **(3) the 40 % re-weighting ≈ −3.4 board** for us, but it hurt more the teams whose Saturday came from trades: t13 (Saturday Negotiating 21.6, the highest, weak duels) 27.72 → 27.69 and #2 → #7; t02 (21.3) out of the top 8; ours was 12.75 (#8), so the cut cost us little · the jump to #3 at snapshot 560: MAL-06 → Pilar (+0.040 ladder, tick 551) + `duel_points` 8.23 → 10.09 (ticks 552-553) · fragile: Duels I runs to ≈ 13:35 and the duel part looks graded against the field [L] (snapshot 520: −0.8 with no event of ours) · pitch material: duelist 91 % deals; ladder program learned from a rival's measured path · next: watch Duels I on the Duel monitor tab, desk Q6
  - Sat 12:12 · **dashboard: new "Duel monitor" tab** (http://127.0.0.1:8765/#duelmon), the current duel session live, read-only, from data the dashboard already reads (**no extra request**: the duelist shares the team's 5 rps) · session + field progress from the feed (`duels.scheduled`, `duel.closed`), our duels from `/api/duels`, `duel_points` from `/api/me` · tiles: our duels done/total + ETA, deals, result after decay and **P lost to rounds**, `duel_points` sparkline, P left on the table, field deal rate · alerts: CRITICAL (rival's standing offer inside our limit with ≤ 2 ticks left; our offer outside our limit; we silent ≥ 4 ticks after a rival price near the deadline), WATCH (acceptable now: +X P after decay), MISSED · live table (our offer vs theirs vs limit, gap, rounds, pie left, ticks left, accept-now value; days for Duels II) · finished table · negotiating Δ per team since the session began (board doesn't split duels out) · complements Lucas's `duelmon` (phone alerts + per-wave review), doesn't replace it · restarted 12:10 on this code, 0 errors, hub on · **Duels I at tick 483:** 4/34 done, 4 deals, 36.7 P of 50 P surplus (**13.3 P, 27 %, lost to rounds**; duel 2540: 7 rounds, 6.7 of 19 lost), field 36/39 deals · seen live: duel 2506 (buyer, limit 103): rival dropped to 96 at tick 480 and we sent 98 the same tick (step computed on their previous 104); it closed at 96 anyway (4.8 P, 6 rounds), so no cost; for Aleks's rounds spec: a same-tick drop can cross our next step · next: watch Duels I on the tab, desk Q6

**Lucas** — Saturday: follow `intel/saturday-plan.md` (verified Fri night by 10 analyses, 4 verifiers, a pre-mortem and a fact-check). Four sessions on Lucas's machine (`intel/saturday-sessions.md`): **Chief of staff** (the only one Lucas talks to), **Operator** (the only game writer for trades and dealers), **Builder** (tools), **Market** (recorder, broker, venue). Morning steps: `intel/morning-start.md`. Trader and analysts are stopped until the operator's 09:00 checks.
  - Sat 16:46 · operator · SAL-10 from Pícaros walked: their 73 → 67 → 63 → 60-FINAL vs our cap 56 (floor 70 bound) · GUARDRAIL corrected (Chief): floor 60 for this one buy at ≤ 63 → retry scheduled 16:51 (open 44, +3, offer-only, structure check)
  - Sat 16:45 · operator · **#1 (30.02)** at snapshot 780 · flag 5 (7225 'last one in all of Madrid… nobody else has it', SAL-05 thread I had closed) = 0 so far → tally 5 flags: +30 / −10 / 0 = net +20 ([?] flags on a closed thread may not count: flag while the thread is open) · SAL-10 buy from Pícaros running (GUARDRAIL floor 70 → cap 56; offer gives card:SAL-10, verified) · message monitor now prints give/want types (bait-and-switch check)
  - Sat 16:42 · operator · **SAL-09 bought from Pícaros at 54** (their 73 → 56, accepted our 54; offer-only + trick guard; their SAL-06 switch flagged): `ladder_points` 0.200 → **0.270 (+0.070, L4 slot 1)**, `neg_points` 63.2 unchanged, cash 126 · plan: SAL-09 → Pilar in the fever (18:04, ~85) · asked the Chief for a floor exception to buy SAL-10 (L4 slot 2) before ~17:33 · (fix for the line below: '( 43.2 → 63.2)' is `neg_points`)
